* Yellow is the Example data and Blue is the valid packet data

* The first 2 bytes are start bytes(0xFF) and last one is the stop byte(0x00).
* Length byte specifies the number of data bytes. 
* Assume that none of the data bytes or extra bytes in the given array are 0xFF or 0x00. 

* Write a function to search for a valid data packet in the passed Data array with at most 1 data packet and extra bytes
* Return whether a valid data packet exists or not. 
* Also save the extracted valid data if present to the resultant array passed to the function.

* Example input and extracted valid packets are shown in image
